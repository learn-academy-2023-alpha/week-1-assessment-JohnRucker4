# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer:
Git is the version of code that we use to create/edit.  GitHub is the database where Git is submitted and used to store, modify, and or merge various versions of code. GitHub can allow multiple developers to obtain code to work on that has been submitted.

Researched answer:
Git is a version control system that we use to manage creation/modification of source code.  GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that makes it easier to manage Git repositories.  This makes collaboration easier and more organized.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer:
Any operator that returns an value that is either true or false. For example, my name is John.  If I'm asked, and I reply with 'John', the Boolean return is true.  An answer that isn't 'John', would be false.

Researched answer:
The Boolean value of an expression is the basis for all Javascript comparisons and conditions that can only have one of two values.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer:
An index is the location of an element(s) within an array.  A value is what the element represents.  For example, in an array containing two numbers, the numbers themselves are values.  Where those numbers are located in the array, would be considered their index.

Researched answer:
The index is the position of an element within an array. It starts with 1 and goes on for as long as there are elements in the array.  This is different from value, because the value is what the element represents.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer:
An array is a list of information.  A string is text information.  You can have strings in an array.  You can have strings that return information in the form of a list.  However, in order for elements in an array to be returned as a string, you may have to input mutators or accessors into the console.log.

Researched answer:
An array is a collection of ordered data between brackets.  Each element in an array can be seperated by a comma. Strings are a collection of characters in between quotations.  Strings can be used for elements within an array.  Elements inside of an array can be returned as strings, with the appropriate mutators and/or accessors.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer:
In pair programming, the 'driver', inputs code at the direction of the 'navigator'.

Researched answer:
Pair programming utilizes the strengths of tackling a workload with multiple people.  One person operates the keyboard while the other communicates data to be inputted. This can help productivity, accountability, focus, accuracy, and comprehension.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions:
A higher order function allows a function to be executed for all of the elements in an array.

2. Jest:
Jest is a framework that allows the testing of pieces of code.

3. Objects:
Objects are key:value pairs inside of curly brackets. They can be used in arrays and each object represent a single element. They can contain functions as well.

4. Method:
An object that has a function is called a method.  Using the JS keyword 'this' can access the value in an object.

5. Classes:
Classes are a function that contain data and behavior.  Several pieces of data can be accessed within a class by using: Constructor - creating objects, This - access value in an object, and New - creates new instance of an object.  Classes are always capitalized, use PascalCase, and objects are lower case.  They are also reusable and can store any kind of data.
